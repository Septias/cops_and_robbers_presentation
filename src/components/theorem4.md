Let 𝓖 be a position independent generalized Cops and Robbers game. If $G_P$ is strongly connected and there exists $X \subseteq P_P$ such that $\mathcal{I} = X \times P_E$, then the
Pursuer has a winning strategy in $\mathcal{G}$ if and only if $\preceq\ =\  V(\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{G}}) =P_P\times P_E$.
