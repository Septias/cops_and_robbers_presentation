- SimpleNix operates on the **abstract syntax tree** (AST) generated by the **parser**
- **`type_term`** traverses the AST and computes expression types
- **`constrain`** is called by `type_term` to create new constraints
- The **first** argument is constrained to be the subtype of the **second** argument
