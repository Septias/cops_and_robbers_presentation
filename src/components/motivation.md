- Create a common framework to **reason about** _all_ reasonably defined **Cops and Robbers** games
- Apply **already known methods** to analyze cobs and robbers games
  - **game length** and if there exist **winning strategies** for any side
- Algorithm to identify **k-cop-winning** graphs with **competitive runtime** complexity
