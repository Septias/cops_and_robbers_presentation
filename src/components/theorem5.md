Let $\mathcal G$ be a position independent generalized Cops and Robbers game. Given the graphs $G_P$ and $G_E$, if $N^+_{G_P}(p_P)$ and $N^+\_{G_E}(p_E)$ can be obtained in time $O(f_P(\mathcal P_P))$ and $O(f_E(\mathcal P_E))$, respectively, then there is a $$O(|\mathcal P _P| \cdot |\mathcal P_E|  \cdot f_P(|\mathcal P_P|)  \cdot f_E(|\mathcal P_E|))$$ algorithm to determine if the Pursuer has a winning strategy, and the length of the game assuming optimal play.
