- We now consider the complexity of this algorithm. It takes $|\mathcal{F}| \leq |\mathcal{P}_P \times \mathcal{P}_E|$ steps to set the entries corresponding to the final positions to zero.
- For each $i$, every entry not yet assigned a value must be tested to see if it can be set to $i$.
- The procedure attempts to fill in $\mathcal M_{\mathcal G}$ row-by-row.
- For each row $p_P$, suppose it takes $f_P(|\mathcal{P_P}|)$ time to obtain $N^+\_{G_P}(p_P)$.
- Possibly all $|\mathcal{P}_E|$ entries in the row must be tested.
- To test whether the entry in column $q_E$ can be assigned a value requires obtaining the list of all possible the Evader moves from $q_E$.
- Suppose this takes time $f_E(|\mathcal{P}_E|)$.
- Then processing row $p_P$ takes  time at most $O(f_P(|\mathcal{P}_P|) \cdot |\mathcal{P}_E|  \cdot f_E(|\mathcal{P}_E|)). $
- There are $|\mathcal{P}_P|$ rows and possibly as many as $|\mathcal{P}_P \times \mathcal{P}_E|$ values for $i$.
- Hence, given the graphs $G_P$ and $G_E$, the algorithm takes time at most $O(|\mathcal{P}_P| \cdot  |\mathcal{P}_E| \cdot f_P(|\mathcal{P}_P|) \cdot f_E(|\mathcal{P}_E|)),$ as desired.
