- For the forward direction, suppose the Pursuer has a winning strategy.
- Then there exists an allowed starting position, say $p_P$, for the Pursuer such that for all $q_E \in P_E$, either $(p_P, q_E) \in \mathcal{F}$ or there exists $w_P \in N^+_{G_P}(p_P)$ and a natural number $j$ such that $q_E \preceq_j w_P$.
- Therefore, there is a natural number $i$ such that $q_E \preceq_i p_P$ for all $q_E \in P_E$.  It now follows by induction that all $q_E \preceq_{i+k} x$ for all $q_E \in P_E$ for all $x$ joined to $p_P$ by a directed path of length $k$.
- The result now follows as $G_P$ is strongly connected.
- The proof of the reverse direction is analogous to the proof of the forward direction in Theorem 1, and so is omitted.
