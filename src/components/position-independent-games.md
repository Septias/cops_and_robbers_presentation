We define a generalized Cops and Robbers game $\mathcal{G}$ to be _position independent_ if for all $p_P \in \mathcal{P}_P$ and $q_E \in \mathcal{P}_E$, whenever $(p_P, q_E) \not\in \mathcal{F}$ the set $\mathcal{A}_P(p_P, q_E)$ depends only on $p_P$ and the set $\mathcal{A}_E(p_P, q_E)$ depends only on $q_E$.

- If the game is not over, from any position of the game, the set of available moves for a player does not depend on the position of the other player


In a position independent game, the set of positions of the game can be taken to be $\mathcal{P}_P \times \mathcal{P}_E$.  Furthermore, because of position independence one can define sets $\mathcal{M}_P$ and $\mathcal{M}_E$ of _allowed moves_ for the Pursuer and the Evader, respectively;  for example $(p_P, p^ \prime_P) \in \mathcal{M}_P$ if and only if $p^\prime_P \in A_P(p_P, q_E)$ (for all $q_E \in \mathcal{P}_E$). The ordered pairs $G_P = (P_P, M_P)$ and $G_E = (P_E, M_E)$ are the _position digraphs_ for the Pursuer and the Evader, respectively. For all $p_P \in \mathcal{P}_P$ and $q_E \in \mathcal{P}_E$, we have that $\mathcal{A}_P(p_P, q_E) = N^+_{G_P}(p_P)$ and $\mathcal{A}_E(p_P, q_E) = N^+_{G_E}(r_E)$. Position independent generalized Cops and Robbers games are thus, games played on digraphs (in a certain sense).
